Welcome to the DMARCeye API reference. These endpoints allow you to access DMARC data and manage reports programmatically.

## Authentication

All requests require an API token. Include it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl http://app.dmarceye.com/api/<endpoint> \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

Generate and manage tokens in your DMARCeye dashboard.
